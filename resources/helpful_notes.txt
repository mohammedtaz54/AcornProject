Naming Schemes
In the HTML use camelCase, in that, first words is all lower case, second word and beyond
capitalize the first letter. No spaces, hypens, or underscores.

For the all files, use snake, aka, all lower case and seperate words with underscores. This should 
help make sure all items stay clean and easy to follow.
